The title suscipicously sounds like a advertisement or paid promotion, doesn't it? I know it does, but still, believe me or not, it't not. I just completed the introductory Algorithms and Data Structures course [Algorithms Part 1], and I can say confidently that it is one of the, if not the best course of it's kind available out there on the interwebs. This course is offered by Princeton University on Coursera, taught by Robert Sedgewick.

I won't make this a lengthy post, but I want to point out some points that made me love this course. FYI, I just did a [course on Algorithms and Data Structures in my uni](http://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~mausam/courses/col106/autumn2017/) too, that too with the exact same syllabus. But I liked this Coursera one over that, mainly because of the assignments, as I go on length bitching about it below.

- __Assignments__: I would recommend someone to do this course just for the assignments. They are fun, introduces a new algorithm to you and requires you to implement it, using the data-structures taught. They don't tell you to simply implement the data-structures, which gets very boring pretty soon. That was the problem with the course at my uni too, one of the assignments of that was just implementing B-Tree. I'm not saying that was a bad decision made by the proffessor ([Prof. Mausam](http://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~mausam/)), but it sure made the assignment a boring a tedious excercise. Anyway, leaving bitching about my college, Algorithms Part 1 is really fun when you do the assignments. I would eagerly finish all the lectures as quickly as possible so that I can start working on the next assignment, that's how fun the assignments are.

- __Course Content__: The course content is really well thought-out and planned too. The lecture is concise, and if you watched it like I did, in 1.25x speed, it will even more concise! (Sorry for the attempted joke.) The lecturer Robert Sedgewick is an extremely renowned computer scientist, author of several books and he discovered the data structure "Red-black Tree"! If you don't know, it's one of the most used data-structure, the default implementation of Tree in Java, C++ and Linux kernel!
