The title suscipicously sounds like a advertisement or paid promotion, doesn't it? I know it does, but still, believe me or not, it't not. I just completed the introductory Algorithms and Data Structures course [Algorithms Part 1], and I can say confidently that it is one of the, if not the best course of it's kind available out there on the interwebs. This course is offered by Princeton University on Coursera, taught by Robert Sedgewick.

I won't make this a lengthy post, but I want to point out some points that made me love this course. FYI, I just did a [course on Algorithms and Data Structures in my uni](http://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~mausam/courses/col106/autumn2017/) too, that too with the exact same syllabus. But I liked this Coursera one over that, mainly because of the assignments, as I go on length bitching about it below.


## Assignments

I would recommend someone to do this course just for the assignments. They are fun, introduces a new algorithm to you and requires you to implement it, using the data-structures taught. They don't tell you to simply implement the data-structures, which gets very boring pretty soon. That was the problem with the course at my uni too, one of the assignments of that was just implementing B-Tree. I'm not saying that was a bad decision made by the proffessor ([Prof. Mausam](http://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~mausam/)), but it sure made the assignment a boring a tedious excercise. Anyway, stopping bitching about my college and going back to the point, Algorithms Part 1 is really fun when you do the assignments. I would eagerly finish all the lectures as quickly as possible so that I can start working on the next assignment, that's how fun the assignments are.

A tip about the assignment, you can resubmit those as many times as possible, so you can keep improving and perfecting them until you get a perfect score, only if you want of course, the passing mark is 80%. This brings me to another point, the autograder. The autograder so rigorous and perfectly worked upon, that makes achieving perfect score in the assignments feel like a great accomplishment. It checks the code for correctness, speed, memory usage, checking these rigoriusly for every single function you wrote, individually. This is the first time I've seen such a rigorous autograder, it makes the assignment 10 times fun.

## Course Content 

The course content is really well thought-out and planned too. The lecture is concise, and if you watched it like I did, in 1.25x speed, it will even more concise! (Sorry for the attempted joke.) The lecturer Robert Sedgewick is an extremely renowned computer scientist, author of several books and he discovered the data structure "Red-black Tree"! If you don't know, it's one of the most used data-structure, the default implementation of Tree in Java, C++ and Linux kernel!

Something I liked about the course very much is how Prof. Sedgewick shows pieces of code as he explains the data structures. Although it's not required, I'd suggest that you implement the data-structures he's teaching parallel to him, like pausing the video and then implementing upto that part, and like that. This makes going through the course a bit slower, but it's worth it. That way the concepts along with their implementation will be engraved in your mind.
Even if you don't do that, the assignments by themselves would give enough chance to excercise those coding-fingers of yours. To be honest, I didn't implemented all the data-structures in the later part of the course myself, I only did the assignments.

Another thing worth mentioning, if you're looking for lots of time-complexity analysis and another theoritical concepts, you won't find that here. Prof. Sedgewick only covers the basics of the theoritical concepts of Computer Science, and for a more mathematical and rigurous introduction to Computer Science you should consider some other courses. This course is mainly intended for beginners in Computer Science, covering mostly practical aspects of it. The next part of this course, Algorithms Part 2, delves deeper into more complex data structures and related algortihms, such as graph and string manipulation.


## Reputation

It is arguably the best MOOC algorithms and data-structure course out there, and if you look around the interwebs(or maybe ask around) a bit, most of the netizens will agree. That's why the course gets a lot of registrations, and the discussion forum of the course is quite active as a result. That may turn out to be helpful to you, if you're the type. I don't really take part in such discussions, rather I like to tackle the problem myself. But for me too, it turned out to be helpful once I got badly stuck on a assignment. So that's a nice thing you can rely upon if it seems too hard for you.


### My code

[Here's the code](https://github.com/SkullTech/algorithms-princeton) I wrote while taking the course. It contains the solutions to the assignments too, so I'd suggest you not to check the folder 'Assignments' unless you're done with it.
