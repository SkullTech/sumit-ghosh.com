As sir Isaac Newton said,

    
> I was like a boy playing on the sea-shore, and diverting myself now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.


While I'm on this journey of finding pebble and shell (pun intended) on the seashore of Hacking and Penetration-Testing, I try to share any interesting information which I come across, in this blog, Tech Kernel.

So collect all the pretty shells you can!
