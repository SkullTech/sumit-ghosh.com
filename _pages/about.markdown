My name is Sumit Ghosh, also known as SkullTech in various corners of the interwebs. Also, I am an INTP, if you are familiar with MBTI. I like:

- Movies
- Philosophy
- Coding
- Exploring and learning new stuff!

I am a Computer Science major studying at IIT Delhi, and as a part-time gig I do consulting work, mainly in the field of Automated QA Testing, using Selenium and such. Check out [my Resume here](https://resume.sumit-ghosh.com). If you want to discuss some potential project with me, want to get to know me better, or maybe ask me out on a date, [contact me here](/contact-me), or simply just drop me a mail at sumit@sumit-ghosh.com.


## About My Blog

As sir Isaac Newton said:
    
> I was like a boy playing on the sea-shore, and diverting myself now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.


While I'm on this journey of finding pebble and shell (pun intended), I try to share any interesting piece of information I come accross, here. I also ramble sometime on random topics I'm passionate about, so bear with me.
