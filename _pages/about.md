### Profile

I am a cosmopolitan currently living in _New Delhi_, India. I like to think of myself as an intellectual, but definitely not tfw to smart. I like to read books, a lot, especially non-fiction.  You can find my _Goodreads_ profile [here](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63000435-sumit-ghosh). Other than that, I indulge in philosophy, computers, photography, music, films and travelling. I know that list seems a little too long, what can I say, I guess I am protean.

Psychometrics — 
  - MBTI: INTP.
  - Big Five: High Openness. Low Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness and Neuroticism.


### About My Blog

As Sir Isaac Newton said —
​    

> I was like a boy playing ‘on’ the sea-shore, and diverting myself now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.


While I’m on this journey of finding pebble and shell—pun intended—I try to share my thoughts and knowledge with the readers, here. It may come across as rambling sometimes, so bear with me.
