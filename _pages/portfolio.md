### Drymail

Drymail is a minimalist wrapper over Python’s existing smtplib and email libraries, designed to be friendly but unrestrictive.

- Supports creating email with HTML content, plaintext content, or both!
- Supports mentioning contacts in the “John Doe" <john@email.com> format.
- Support standard headers like CC, BCC, Reply-To and Authors.
