_Ramblings of a madman who’s trying to think — ergo, exist._

## About Me

I’m Sumit Ghosh, also known as SkullTech in various corners of the interwebs. I like philosophy, computers, art forms–especially visual arts, and exploration—through travelling or otherwise. You can read more about me and my online presence here in the [_about_](/about) page.

I’m a computer science major studying at IIT Delhi, and as a part–time gig I do freelance consulting. Check out my resume [here](https://sumit-ghosh.com/resume-vocational). If you want to discuss some potential project with me, want to get to know me better, or maybe ask me out on a date, just drop me a mail at sumit@sumit-ghosh.com.


## About My Blog

As Sir Isaac Newton said —
    
> I was like a boy playing ‘on’ the sea-shore, and diverting myself now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.


While I’m on this journey of finding pebble and shell—pun intended—I try to share my thoughts and knowledge with the readers, here. It may come across as rambling sometimes, so bear with me.
