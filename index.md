Hello! I'm Sumit, a software engineer by day and a lunatic by night. This is my tech blog where I post about computers, programming, and things of that sort.

Oh and I also have [another blog](https://okrefusal.com/) where I post half-baked random musings, if that's your thing, feel free to check it out.

Below are some selected posts, go to the archive page to see all the posts on this blog.
