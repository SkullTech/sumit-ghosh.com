_The lunatic is on the grass._

## About

Hello! I'm Sumit Ghosh, a computer science major studying at IIT Delhi. You might've seen me as `SkullTech` in some parts of the interwebs.

You can check out the portfolio of my _programmer self_ [here](https://skghosh.me/){:target="_blank"}. You can read about my _human self_ and my online presence in the [_about_](/about/) page. Drop me a mail at `sumit@sumit-ghosh.com` if you want to talk.

Oh and I also have [another blog](https://okrefusal.com/) where I post half-baked random musings, if that's your thing, feel free to check it out.
