# Why are octaves what they are

From an evolutionary point of view, many of the _finer_ qualities of human beings are rather unnecessary. One prime example of these qualities would be having a taste for the arts.

But we have to understand, evolution does not “plan” anything. The process is completely spontaneous and random — random mutations happen, everyone tries to survive and continue the generations, but there is limited resource and more often than not there is competition, so not all succeed. One mutation that helped a species survive the competition, may turn into something very obsolete millions of years later, but that species can’t go back and undo it and start all over to make it “perfect”. Evolution continues with what it has and build with that.

Basically, we have to look at it from the point of view of Physics. Physics says, sound is vibrations in the air. Nothing less, nothing more.
