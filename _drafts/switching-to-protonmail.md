By now, it is well-known that for many of the _free_ products we use on the internet, such as Facebook and Google, we are paying with our identity. Hoping to get a free product, we are becoming the product. As Adam Conover puts it in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pFX2P7JLwA)

> If you're not paying, you're not the customer - you're the product.

By the way, do watch that video. In a funny and casual way, it shows the real price we pay when we use these supposedly _free_ websites.

Fortunately, we can get out of this system. in this post-_"[Global surveillance disclosures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_surveillance_disclosures_(2013%E2%80%93present))"_ age, it's high-time that we do so, starting with the products we use everyday. Free Internet activists around the world are working hard to help us in this aspect.

## Switching to Protonmail

I had heard about Protonmail a few times before, it sounded interesting, but I never took it seriously. Then eventually I forgot about it. Yesterday, when I was going through the blog of a senior of my college (kind of a mentor figure), I noticed that his public email was a Protonmail one. It caught my attention obviously, as 90+ percent of email addresses I see are Gmail ones. After looking it up and reading up about it, I decided to get one. I'm planning to move to protonmail permanently, but it will take some time.
