# Reverse Engineering setup on Ubuntu

As the storage space on my laptop is not much (256 GB SSD), A dilemma I faced is choosing between Ubuntu and Kali Linux as the linux distribution I'd be going with. My laptop came preinstalled with Windows 10, and I was planning to keep that too, for some occassional gaming needs. If I had about 1 TB of storage like most modern laptops have, I'd be going with triple booting Windows 10 + Ubuntu + Kali, but simply I don't have enough space to do that in my laptop. So I had to choose between Kali and Ubuntu.
