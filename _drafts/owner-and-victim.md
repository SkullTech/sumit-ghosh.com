The central concept Steve Chandler focuses on in his book [Reinventing Yourself](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/93360) is that of being an _Owner_ vs being a _Victim_. To explain it while maintaining brevity, 

- A _Victim_ is someone who thinks of himself as a victim of the circumstances.
- An _Owner_ is someone who doesn't ever think of himself as a victim, but rather takes up responsibility of his life.

I won't go into the philosophy of Victim and Owner here, but instead I'll share a recent epiphany I had which reinforced my belief in this philosophy.

From my childhood, I have always taken an interest in learning things on my own, especially technical things. I started learning about programming, hacking, reverse-engineering consecutively leading up to computer architecture, and more, on my own in my childhood. Then in high-school, I was a pretty good programmer and even started making some money selling my programming skills. Naturally, I took up computer science as major in college. But then in college, I was finding it hard to learn things which were being taught currently. So what went wrong? It's not that I don't like computer science, in face I love it so much that I read theoritical computer sciecne concepts in my spare time, but only those which are not in the course syllabus. Whenver it feels like I'm studying for an exam or for grades, the feeling changes entirely. So what's going wrong here? The education system is partially to blame, but there's a deeper problem here that we need to address.

You must've experienced this too, when you decide something to do it and then do it, it doesn't feel like a chore.
