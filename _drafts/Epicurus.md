For Epicurus, the pursuit of philosophy is happiness. If we have happiness, we have everything. So, our actions should be directed towards attaining it—thus philosophy. This is novel—at least different—than most of the other.

Pleasure is the absence of pain in the body.


Epicurus says — 

> Accustom yourself to believe that death is nothing to us, for good and evil imply awareness, and death is the privation of all awareness. … It is nothing, then, either to the living or to the dead, for with the living it is not and the dead exist no longer. 

This view of death is evidently much self–centric. Death is nothing only to the individual who’s the subject thereof. But for this loved ones, his death means much — his death causes grief and lament. So this epicurean view of death is evidently selfish.

But this brings us to another question, why do we lament for someone’s death? If we were to follow Epicurus’ footsteps on regarding death as nothing, we should not lament anyone’s death. A religious person would also say so — taking into account his views on heaven and such, he would say that the dead person is in a different and much better place after, thus lamenting for this becomes foolishness. Despite being the end–goals being same—namely not regarding the death of a beloved as a bad thing—the religious person and the epicurean would differ on the way they reach that goal.


This discussion would lead us to another one, the absurdity of life — life as in life–forms.
