Blockchain is a favorite buzzword among tech news-sites now-a-days. It seems like everybody is trying to use the word just to sound smart, even if they have have no idea how it works. I got interested in it too naturally, especially with the ever-continuous rise of price of Bitcoin and Ethereum, also startups starting to make clever things using Blockchain, it demands some attention from tech guys like me. So I decided to give it a shot.

The first thing I did was read the paper on Bitcoin by Satoshi Nakamoto, and that itself made me understand the genius of this technology. In a very simple and clever way, blockchain solves the double-spending problem of Internet currencies, eliminating any need for third-parties like banks or mints. I may be getting ahead now, so without diving headfirst into this, let me first clear up a few things.

## Writing a Blockchain using Python

From the name itself, we can guess that Blockchain is, a chain of 'Blocks'. In the case of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, these 'blocks' consist mainly of transactions, but the way I understand, the blocks can contain all kinds of 'records', records that need to be preserved and later queried. The use of the term 'records' makes us think of databases, and that thought-process is not so wrong. Blockchain can be thought of as a new way to look at database, a decentralized database without the need of a server. This also solves another problem, the problem of having a single point-of-failure.

### Implementing 'Blocks'
