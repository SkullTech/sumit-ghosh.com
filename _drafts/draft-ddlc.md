Alright, let's do this.

I first learned about Doki Doki Literature Club through Reddit, there's this [subreddit of INTPs](http://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/) which I follow, and this game has been recommended there a few times ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/7l4arw/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/7lzvaq/)). People also said that this game can be really disturbing and depressing, so it piqued my interest, but I didn't think anything more of it. But looking it up on Google, I saw that this game is another beast entirely! It has 10/10 rating on steam, and have gained quite a cult following. Top game journals have praised this game as well. So I made up my mind about giving it a try.

This was my first visual novel experience, so I didn't know what I was getting into. After playing it, I can say this is definitely something you want to experience (I use the word experience rather than play because you don't really play it, the story is pretty linear). It handles topics like depression, obsession, possesiveness, and all kinds of demons we all have under our skin in a very humane way. This game is categorized as Psychological Horror. It wasn't really scary for me, but it surely was very intersting in a disturbing way. But I'll admit, for the weak of heart, this may be more than tolerable. But if you can go through movies like Requiem for a Dream and A Clockwork Orange, I'm sure you will be fine with this one too.

Now for the problems this game had, the first half of the first act of the game is very mundane and boring, I guess it would really bore you if you've played lots of visual novels before. It didn't bore me that much as this whole format was intriguing and novel for me, but I got bored of it pretty quick. But once the interesting things start happening, you wouldn't be able to put it down. I played the whole game on a single sitting (took me about 5 hours or so), and I didn't even get up for some water or anything. It was riveting on a different level. One of the reasons of this was you couldn't predict the characters and their motivations. At the first they seem like really naive typical anime moe girls, but as the story progresses you find out their inner demons.
